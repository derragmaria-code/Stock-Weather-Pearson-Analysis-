## 📌 Focus
Comparative Pearson Correlation between Precipitation and Sectoral Performance.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This report contrasts the impact of precipitation on two distinct emerging markets:  
- **Moroccan MASI** → Mining / Multi-sectoral impact  
- **Pre-War Ukraine** → Agriculture / Telecommunications  

While conventional skepticism labels weather as a "secondary pulse," the data suggests that in specific economic structures, weather acts as a **primary fundamental driver**.  
- In **Ukraine**, the correlation is hyper-specific to Agriculture.  
- In **Morocco**, it acts as a **systemic catalyst** across multiple sectors.

## 2. Sectoral Divergence: Agriculture vs. Telecommunications (Ukraine)

### 🌱 Agriculture (2019–2021)
- **Pearson Correlation (r):** `0.9764`  
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²):** `0.9534`  
- **Finding:** 95.3% of agricultural stock variance (e.g., Kernel) is explained by rainfall.  
- **Interpretation:** Rain is not a pulse—it is the **production line** itself.  

### 📡 Telecommunications
- **Pearson Correlation (r):** `-0.0313`  
- **Finding:** The digital economy operates independently of weather.  
- **Drivers:** 4G penetration, USD/UAH exchange rates.

## 3. The Morocco Case: Systemic vs. Specific

| Metric              | Ukraine (Agri) | Morocco (Mining/General) |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Correlation (r)** | 0.9764         | 0.2754                   |
| **Scope**           | Deep & Narrow: harvest only | Broad & Shallow: national sentiment |
| **Workforce Link**  | Moderate (export focus) | High (35–40% of population in Agri) |

**The "Solid" Argument for Morocco:**  
Rainfall impacts multiple sectors simultaneously:  
1. **Mining (Managem):** Lower costs, improved outlook.  
2. **Banking:** Reduced rural credit risk.  
3. **Consumer Goods:** Increased disposable income for ~40% of households.  

---

## 4. Statistical Synthesis
- **Ukraine:** Weather = **Specific Fundamental** (Agriculture only).  
- **Morocco:** Weather = **Systemic Catalyst** (entire index).  
- High \( r = 0.97 \) vs. moderate \( r = 0.27 \) → Morocco’s effect is **diluted across sectors**, not weaker.  

---

## 5. Conclusion
- In **Morocco**, rainfall functions as an **Operating System** for the economy.  
- In **Ukraine**, weather’s role is confined to agriculture; service/tech sectors are insulated.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Treat weather data as a **Primary Indicator** for Moroccan equities.  
- Treat weather as a **Sector-Specific Indicator** for Ukrainian agricultural exports.  
- Ignore weather for Eastern European service/tech sectors.
